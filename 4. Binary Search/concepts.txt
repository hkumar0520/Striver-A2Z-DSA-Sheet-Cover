### **Comprehensive List of Binary Search Problems**  

Binary Search is a powerful algorithm used to efficiently search in sorted data. Below is a categorized list of problems that cover all variations and applications of **Binary Search**.

---

## **🔹 1. Basic Binary Search Problems**
1. **Standard Binary Search**  
   - Find an element in a sorted array.
2. **Lower Bound** (`first occurrence of target or first element ≥ target`)  
   - Implement `lower_bound()` manually.
3. **Upper Bound** (`first element > target`)  
   - Implement `upper_bound()` manually.
4. **Find First and Last Position of an Element in a Sorted Array**  
   - Use binary search to find occurrences.
5. **Find the Square Root of a Number**  
   - Compute `√x` using binary search.

📌 **Practice**: Implement these from scratch without using built-in functions.
