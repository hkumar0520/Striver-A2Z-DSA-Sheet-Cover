Let's analyze the provided code in terms of **time complexity** and **space complexity**.

### Code Breakdown:
The goal of the function `minBitFlips` is to determine the number of bits that need to be flipped to convert `start` to `goal`.

1. **XOR operation (`start ^ goal`)**:
   - The XOR operation compares each bit of `start` and `goal`. If the bits are different, the corresponding bit in the result is set to 1; otherwise, it's set to 0. This operation takes constant time \(O(1)\) with respect to the size of the integers, but the number of operations depends on the bit size of the integers.

2. **Counting set bits (`num = num & (num - 1)`)**:
   - The `num & (num - 1)` operation removes the lowest set bit (rightmost 1) from the number. This reduces the number of set bits in the number by one on each iteration.
   - The while loop continues until `num` becomes 0.
   - The number of iterations of the loop is determined by the number of **set bits** in `num`. The operation `num & (num - 1)` reduces the number of set bits by 1 in each iteration, so the loop runs as many times as there are set bits in `num`.

### Time Complexity:
- The XOR operation `start ^ goal` is constant time \(O(1)\), but the number of set bits in the XOR result determines how many times the while loop runs.
- In the worst case, the number of iterations in the loop is proportional to the number of set bits in `num`, which can be represented as \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the number of set bits in `num`.

Thus, the **time complexity** is **O(k)**, where \(k\) is the number of set bits in the XOR of `start` and `goal`.

Since the number of set bits \(k\) can be at most \(O(\log n)\), where \(n\) is the number represented by `start` or `goal`, we can also say the time complexity is **O(\log n)**, where \(n\) is the size of the number (bitwise size).

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is determined by the amount of extra space used by the algorithm.
- The function uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like `num` and `countSetBits`.
- Therefore, the **space complexity** is **O(1)**.

### Summary:
- **Time Complexity**: O(k) (where \(k\) is the number of set bits in the XOR of `start` and `goal`)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
