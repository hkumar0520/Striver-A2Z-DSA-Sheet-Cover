Let's analyze the **time complexity** and **space complexity** of the given code.

### Code Explanation:

The function `singleNumber` is designed to find the element that appears **only once** in an array where all other elements appear exactly twice. The approach uses the **XOR operation** to identify the unique element.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `result` is initialized to `0`. This variable will be used to accumulate the XOR result.

2. **Loop over the array**:
   - The function loops over each element of the array `nums`.
   - For each element `nums[i]`, it performs a **XOR** operation with `result`: `result = result ^ nums[i]`.
     - XOR has a special property: if you XOR a number with itself, the result is `0` (i.e., `a ^ a = 0`), and if you XOR a number with `0`, the result is the number itself (i.e., `a ^ 0 = a`).
     - Therefore, when you XOR all elements in the array, the elements that appear twice will cancel each other out (because `x ^ x = 0`), and the element that appears only once will remain in `result`.

3. **Return the result**:
   - After completing the loop, `result` holds the element that appears only once in the array, and this value is returned.

### Time Complexity:

- The algorithm processes each element of the array exactly once in the `for` loop. The number of operations is proportional to the size of the array `nums`.
- If `n` is the number of elements in the array `nums`, the loop runs `n` times, and each XOR operation takes constant time \(O(1)\).

Therefore, the **time complexity** is:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

### Space Complexity:

- The function uses a constant amount of extra space:
  - The variable `result` is a single integer, and the loop iterates over the input array, but no additional data structures are used.
  - The input array `nums` is passed by reference, and its space is not counted towards the additional space complexity.

Thus, the **space complexity** is:
- **O(1)** (constant space).

### Final Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), constant space.
