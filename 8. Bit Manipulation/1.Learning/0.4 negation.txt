Negation and `NOT` in bitwise operations are closely related but have distinct meanings depending on the context.

### **1. Bitwise Negation (`~` in C, C++, Python, etc.)**
- This is a bitwise **complement** operator.
- It flips all the bits in a binary representation: `1` becomes `0` and `0` becomes `1`.
- In two's complement representation (used for signed integers), `~x` is equivalent to `-(x + 1)`.

#### **Example (8-bit representation)**
```
 x  =  00001100   (12 in decimal)
~x  =  11110011   (-13 in decimal, assuming two's complement)
```
In Python:
```python
x = 12
print(~x)  # Output: -13
```
This happens because `~x` in two's complement is `-(x + 1)`.

### **2. Logical NOT (`!` in C, C++, `not` in Python)**
- It is a **logical** operation that evaluates to `True` or `False`.
- It does **not** operate at the bit level but rather on truth values.

#### **Example:**
In C:
```c
int x = 12;
printf("%d", !x);  // Output: 0 (because 12 is "truthy")
```
In Python:
```python
x = 12
print(not x)  # Output: False
```
- `not 0` → `True`
- `not 1` → `False`
- `not 12` → `False`
- `not -5` → `False` (because nonzero numbers are "truthy")

### **Key Differences**
| Feature           | Bitwise Negation `~x` | Logical NOT `not x` |
|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Works on        | Individual bits | Truth values (True/False) |
| Operation      | Flips all bits (`1 ↔ 0`) | Returns `False` for truthy values, `True` for falsy ones |
| Example Input  | `00001100 (12)` | `12` (truthy) |
| Example Output | `11110011 (-13 in two's complement)` | `False` |
