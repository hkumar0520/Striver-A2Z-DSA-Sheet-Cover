Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the given code.

### Code Overview:
The function `bitManipulation` performs several bit manipulations on the input number `num`:
1. **Check the i-th bit**: It uses a right shift (`>>`) and a bitwise AND (`&`) to check the value of the i-th bit.
2. **Set the i-th bit**: It uses a bitwise OR (`|`) to set the i-th bit.
3. **Clear the i-th bit**: It uses a bitwise AND (`&`) and a bitwise NOT (`~`) to clear the i-th bit.
4. The result of these manipulations is printed.

### Time Complexity:
1. **Right Shift and Bitwise AND** (`num >> i & 1`):
   - The right shift operation `num >> i` takes **O(1)** time because shifting an integer in memory is a constant-time operation.
   - The bitwise AND operation `&` and comparison `? 1 : 0` also take **O(1)** time.

2. **Bitwise OR** (`num | (1 << i)`):
   - Shifting the number `1` to the left by `i` (i.e., `1 << i`) takes **O(1)** time.
   - The bitwise OR operation `|` also takes **O(1)** time.

3. **Bitwise AND with NOT** (`num & (~(1 << i))`):
   - Shifting the number `1` to the left by `i` takes **O(1)** time.
   - The bitwise NOT operation `~` is also a constant-time operation (**O(1)**).
   - The bitwise AND operation `&` takes **O(1)** time.

Since all the operations inside the function are constant-time operations, the total time complexity is:
- **Time Complexity**: **O(1)**.

### Space Complexity:
1. The function uses a fixed number of variables: `ithBit`, `afterIthBitSet`, `clearIthBit`, and `i` (with `i` being modified). 
2. These variables consume a constant amount of space, regardless of the input size.

Since there is no dynamic memory allocation or growth in space usage as the input grows, the space complexity is:
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**.

### Conclusion:
- **Time Complexity**: **O(1)** (constant time)
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** (constant space)
