Negative numbers are stored in a computer using a system called **two's complement**. This method is widely used because it simplifies arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction, and makes it easy to represent both positive and negative integers using the same binary structure.

Here’s a simplified explanation of how two's complement works:

### 1. **Binary Representation of Positive Numbers:**
   A positive number is stored just like any other binary number. For example, the number 5 in an 8-bit binary representation is:
   ```
   00000101
   ```

### 2. **Converting Positive Numbers to Negative in Two's Complement:**
   To convert a positive number to its negative counterpart:
   - **Step 1:** Write the number in binary (as you would normally).
   - **Step 2:** Invert all the bits (change 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).
   - **Step 3:** Add 1 to the result.

   Example: Convert +5 to -5 using 8-bit representation:
   - Start with +5: `00000101`
   - Invert the bits: `11111010`
   - Add 1: `11111010 + 1 = 11111011`
   So, -5 is stored as `11111011` in two's complement (8 bits).

### 3. **Range of Values:**
   In an n-bit system, the range of integers that can be represented in two's complement is:
   - Minimum: `-2^(n-1)`
   - Maximum: `2^(n-1) - 1`
   
   For an 8-bit number, the range is from `-128` to `127`.

### Why Two's Complement?
- **Single Representation for Zero:** In two's complement, zero is represented by all bits being 0 (`00000000` in 8-bit), and this is the same regardless of whether the number is positive or negative.
- **Simplified Arithmetic:** Two's complement allows the same addition and subtraction algorithms to work for both positive and negative numbers, which simplifies hardware design.

### Example of a Range with 8 Bits:
- **+5**: `00000101`
- **-5**: `11111011`
- **+127**: `01111111`
- **-128**: `10000000` (this is the smallest number that can be represented in 8-bit two's complement)

This is how computers store negative numbers efficiently.

To convert a **two's complement** binary number back to its decimal value, especially for negative numbers, you follow these steps:

### Steps to Convert from Two's Complement to Decimal:

1. **Check the sign**:  
   Look at the most significant bit (MSB), also called the **leftmost bit**. 
   - If the MSB is `0`, the number is positive, and you can convert it directly from binary to decimal.
   - If the MSB is `1`, the number is negative, and you'll need to perform additional steps to find its decimal equivalent.

2. **For a negative number (MSB is 1)**:  
   - **Step 1:** Invert all the bits (change `0` to `1` and `1` to `0`).
   - **Step 2:** Add `1` to the result from Step 1. This will give you the magnitude of the number in binary.
   - **Step 3:** Convert the result from Step 2 to decimal and add a negative sign to it.

### Example 1: Convert `11111011` (2's complement, 8-bit) to Decimal

1. **Check the MSB**:  
   The MSB is `1`, so this is a negative number.

2. **Invert the bits**:  
   Inverting `11111011` gives `00000100`.

3. **Add 1**:  
   `00000100` + `1` = `00000101`.

4. **Convert the result to decimal**:  
   `00000101` in binary is `5`.

5. **Add a negative sign**:  
   Since it was a negative number, the result is `-5`.

So, `11111011` in two's complement (8-bit) equals `-5` in decimal.

### Example 2: Convert `11001010` (2's complement, 8-bit) to Decimal

1. **Check the MSB**:  
   The MSB is `1`, so this is a negative number.

2. **Invert the bits**:  
   Inverting `11001010` gives `00110101`.

3. **Add 1**:  
   `00110101` + `1` = `00110110`.

4. **Convert the result to decimal**:  
   `00110110` in binary is `54`.

5. **Add a negative sign**:  
   The result is `-54`.

So, `11001010` in two's complement (8-bit) equals `-54` in decimal.

### Example 3: Convert `00000101` (2's complement, 8-bit) to Decimal

1. **Check the MSB**:  
   The MSB is `0`, so this is a positive number.

2. **No need to invert or add 1**:  
   Directly convert `00000101` from binary to decimal.  
   `00000101` in binary is `5`.

So, `00000101` in two's complement (8-bit) equals `5` in decimal.

### Key Points:
- If the MSB is `0`, the number is positive, and you can convert it directly from binary to decimal.
- If the MSB is `1`, the number is negative, so you invert the bits, add `1`, and convert to decimal, then apply the negative sign.

This is how you can extract the original number from its two's complement representation.
