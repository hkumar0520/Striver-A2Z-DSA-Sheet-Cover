  public:
    string oddEven(int n) {
        // code here
        
        return  (n & 1) ? "odd": "even";
    }
};


Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the given code.

### Code Overview:
The function `oddEven` checks whether the integer `n` is odd or even by using a bitwise operation:
1. The expression `n & 1` checks if the least significant bit (LSB) of the number `n` is 1 (odd) or 0 (even).
   - If the result of `n & 1` is 1, it means `n` is odd.
   - If the result is 0, it means `n` is even.
   
   The function returns the string `"odd"` if `n` is odd, or `"even"` if `n` is even.

### Time Complexity:
1. **Bitwise AND Operation** (`n & 1`):
   - The bitwise AND operation `n & 1` takes **O(1)** time because it only checks the least significant bit of the number, which is a constant-time operation.

2. **Ternary Operator** (`? "odd" : "even"`):
   - The ternary operator evaluates to either `"odd"` or `"even"`. This operation is **O(1)** because it is a simple conditional check that does not depend on the size of the input.

Since all the operations in the function are constant-time operations, the total time complexity is:
- **Time Complexity**: **O(1)** (constant time).

### Space Complexity:
1. The function uses a fixed number of variables:
   - `n` is the input, and the result of the ternary operation is a string (`"odd"` or `"even"`).
2. The strings `"odd"` and `"even"` are constant in size, and the function does not dynamically allocate memory based on the input size.

Since there is no dynamic memory allocation and the space used is independent of the size of the input, the space complexity is:
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** (constant space).

### Conclusion:
- **Time Complexity**: **O(1)** (constant time)
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** (constant space)
