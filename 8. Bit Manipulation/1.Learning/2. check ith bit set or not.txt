        // Your code here

        return  n & 1<<k ? 1: 0;

};



Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the given code:

### Code Overview:
The function `checkKthBit` checks whether the `k`-th bit of the integer `n` is set (i.e., 1) or not. Here's how it works:

1. **Bitwise Shift and Check**:
   - The expression `1 << k` shifts the number `1` left by `k` positions, effectively creating a mask where only the `k`-th bit is set to 1.
   - The bitwise AND operation `n & (1 << k)` checks if the `k`-th bit of `n` is set to 1.
   - If the result is non-zero, it means the `k`-th bit is set (1), so the function returns `1`. Otherwise, it returns `0`.

### Time Complexity:
1. **Left Shift Operation** (`1 << k`):
   - The left shift operation `1 << k` takes constant time **O(1)** because shifting an integer by a fixed number of bits is a constant-time operation.

2. **Bitwise AND Operation** (`n & (1 << k)`):
   - The bitwise AND operation `&` takes constant time **O(1)** since it's a bitwise operation on two integers.

3. **Comparison and Return** (`n & (1 << k) ? 1 : 0`):
   - The comparison and the ternary operator `? 1 : 0` also take constant time **O(1)**.

Since all operations inside the function are constant-time operations, the total time complexity is:
- **Time Complexity**: **O(1)** (constant time).

### Space Complexity:
1. The function uses a fixed number of variables (`n`, `k`, and the result of the bitwise operation). These variables do not depend on the size of the input, so they consume constant space.

Since there is no dynamic memory allocation or growth in space usage as the input grows, the space complexity is:
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** (constant space).

### Conclusion:
- **Time Complexity**: **O(1)** (constant time)
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** (constant space)
