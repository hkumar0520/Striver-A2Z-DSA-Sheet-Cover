class Solution{   
public:
    pair<int, int> get(int a, int b){
        //complete the function here
         a = a^b;
         b = a^b;
         a = a^b;
         
         return {a,b};
    }
};



In this problem, we are tasked with analyzing the time and space complexity of a function in the given class `Solution`.

### Function Description

The function `get(int a, int b)` swaps two integers using the XOR operation. The XOR operation is performed in three steps:

1. `a = a ^ b;`
   - Here, `a` becomes the XOR of `a` and `b`. This operation stores the bitwise difference of `a` and `b` in `a`.

2. `b = a ^ b;`
   - Now, `b` becomes the XOR of the modified `a` and the original `b`. This effectively assigns the original value of `a` to `b`.

3. `a = a ^ b;`
   - Finally, `a` becomes the XOR of the modified `a` (which is the XOR of original `a` and `b`) and the modified `b` (which is the original value of `a`). This step assigns the original value of `b` to `a`.

In the end, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped.

### Time Complexity Analysis

- The function consists of three XOR operations, which each take constant time, i.e., **O(1)**. 
- There are no loops or recursive calls involved, and each operation is performed a fixed number of times.

Thus, the **time complexity** of the `get` function is **O(1)**.

### Space Complexity Analysis

- The function does not use any extra data structures or dynamic memory allocation.
- It only uses a fixed number of variables (`a` and `b`), which are updated in-place.
- No additional memory is required beyond the input parameters and the return value.

Thus, the **space complexity** of the `get` function is **O(1)**.

### Summary

- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

This is a highly efficient implementation for swapping two integers using XOR.
