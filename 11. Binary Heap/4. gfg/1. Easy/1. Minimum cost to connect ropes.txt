Let's analyze the **time complexity** and **space complexity** of the given code, which computes the minimum cost of connecting ropes (similar to the **Huffman coding** problem or the **optimal merge pattern** problem).

### Code Explanation:

The `minCost` function solves the problem of finding the minimum cost to connect all the ropes. The process involves:
1. **Using a min-heap (priority queue)** to always select the two smallest ropes.
2. **Combining the two smallest ropes** by summing their lengths, adding that sum to the total cost, and then putting the resulting rope back into the heap.
3. **Repeating the process** until only one rope remains, and the accumulated sum is returned as the minimum cost.

### Time Complexity:

1. **Building the Priority Queue**:
   - The algorithm starts by inserting all elements from the input array `arr` into the priority queue.
   - There are `n` elements in `arr`, and inserting each element into the priority queue takes **O(log n)** time.
   - So, the time complexity for this step is **O(n log n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

2. **Processing the Elements in the Priority Queue**:
   - In the while loop, we repeatedly:
     - Extract the two smallest elements from the priority queue (each extraction takes **O(log n)** time).
     - Combine the two elements and push their sum back into the priority queue (which also takes **O(log n)** time).
   - The loop runs `n - 1` times (since we reduce the number of ropes by one each time). For each iteration, the operations inside the loop take **O(log n)** time.
   - So, the time complexity for this step is **O(n log n)**.

3. **Overall Time Complexity**:
   - Building the priority queue: **O(n log n)**
   - Processing the ropes: **O(n log n)**
   
   Therefore, the overall time complexity is:
   \[
   O(n \log n)
   \]

### Space Complexity:

1. **Priority Queue**:
   - The priority queue stores all the elements from the array, which requires space for `n` elements.
   - So, the space complexity for the priority queue is **O(n)**.

2. **Auxiliary Space**:
   - Apart from the priority queue, there are no other significant space-consuming data structures used.

Therefore, the overall space complexity is:
\[
O(n)
\]

### Final Complexity Summary:

- **Time Complexity**: **O(n log n)**
- **Space Complexity**: **O(n)**
