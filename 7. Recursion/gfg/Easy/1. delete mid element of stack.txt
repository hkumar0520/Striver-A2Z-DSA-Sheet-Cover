### **Time and Space Complexity Analysis**

#### **Understanding the Code**
The function `deleteMid(stack<int>& s)` is designed to remove the middle element from the stack. It does so by:
1. Using recursion (`deleteMidStack`) to traverse the stack while keeping track of the total number of elements.
2. Popping elements recursively until the middle element is reached.
3. Skipping the middle element and pushing the remaining elements back onto the stack.

#### **Time Complexity Analysis**
- The function recursively traverses the stack, popping elements one by one until it reaches the middle.
- This traversal takes **O(N)** time, where **N** is the number of elements in the stack.
- After skipping the middle element, it pushes back the remaining elements, which also takes **O(N)** time.
- **Total time complexity:**  
  \[
  O(N) + O(N) = O(N)
  \]

#### **Space Complexity Analysis**
- The function uses recursion, and the maximum depth of the recursive call stack is **O(N)** (since it processes all elements).
- No additional data structures are used apart from a few integer variables (`totalElements`, `countt`).
- **Total space complexity:**  
  \[
  O(N) \quad \text{(due to recursive call stack)}
  \]

### **Final Complexity**
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(N) \)
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(N) \) (due to recursion)
